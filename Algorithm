Initialize input and output file strings.
Execute 'createFile()' method.
Output file 'Debit_Cards.txt' is created.
Execute 'readFile()' method.
Create an object to reference the input file.
Create an object to reference the output file.
Use the object to read the input file from the network drive.
Start a loop that reads the text file line by line.
Stores each line into a string variable 'data'.
Split the line into 2 with the first space character found in the line. Each line has a date in the beginning and
    is separated by a space. Thus, isolating the date in each line.
Store the date in a string variable 'dateInString'.
Initialize string variables 'fromDate' and 'toDate' to serve from-to date range.
Convert these string date variables to actual date variables using date patter 'M/d/yyyy'.
Select date range in the conditional if statement.
Logic will look for the text "Not Needed into succeeded" and the specific BINs.
Store the second part of the string date to 'pan'.
From the 'pan', strip the card number by using substring and write it to the output file.
